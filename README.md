In this PS, we want to look at the relationship between the Big 5 personality traits, age, gender, BMI, and exercise habits. To do so will require some data wrangling...

This dataset (ipip50_sample.csv) includes measures of the Big 5 Inventory personality scales which index traits of Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Neuroticism, and Openness. The dataset also includes age, BMI, and exercise habits. In total, there are 1000 participants, so justifiably a BIG DATA dataset.

One important note about this PS is that the script includes code for generating figures. You don't need to edit this code. But, you will have to create the tibbles that are necessary for these figures. In the figures folder, you'll find pdfs of what the figures should look like. So, when you are working on this PS, you can generate figures and check your work to make sure your data wrangling is successful. 

As always, have fun!
